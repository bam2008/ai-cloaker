# Text Cloaker

This script makes AI generated content in a Google doc **completely undetectable** by all AI content detectors and does so without changing the words.
It is useful because a teacher using an AI detection tool will not be able to catch you if you are submitting something like an essay written by ChatGPT.
The script randomly adds "hidden" periods (periods with a font size of 1 and a foreground color of white) after words in sentences.
This breaks up your sentences into smaller sentences that make no sense, and therefore AI detectors believe it must have been entirely written by a human.
This process can also be done manually by copying and pasting "hidden" periods throughout the text as the script does.
However, this becomes very tedious for content longer than a couple of sentences, and once you get the script set up, it becomes very easy to do this to any document very quickly.
